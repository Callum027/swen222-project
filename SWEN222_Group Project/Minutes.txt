- Decided on the high-level design of the program:
                  Client <-> UI
                     ^
                     |
                     V
  Data Storage <-> Server <-> Game World / Logic

- All of the game state will be stored and controlled by the server, while
  the client will receive just enough of the game world status from the server
  to allow the client to view their perspective of the world and do all the
  possible actions.

- Starting the initial documentation of the game, describing the story and the
  controls.
